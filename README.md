### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently in my third year at Yale-NUS College. I have two years of experience using R and Python and recently picked up QGIS.

_I thought I would be a philosophy major, after that, an urban studies major but finally settled on data science._

Projects:
- :bus: Mapped real world bus travel data obtained from LTA.
- :palm_tree: Analysed mangrove species diversity on Pulau Ubin.
- :mask: Compared government restrictions during Covid using time-series clustering.
- :syringe: Stroke prediction model.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning SQL and linux. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about liberal education.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nicholasko@u.yale-nus.edu.sg
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to ride my motorcycle.
